Pre-requisite
=============
You need to install Vonage::Click2Call perl module. You can do so from cspan.
For your convenience the Vonage::Click2Call.pm is included. You can create
~/opt/site_perl folder and place it there. So the file path for the module will
be

~/opt/site_perl/Vonage/Click2Call.pm

Install
=======
Step 1
------
You will need to create file ~/.vonage/phone_list with following format
##########################################################################
Short_Name	Index		Phone_Number 	Comments	
##########################################################################
Please note that the Short_Name and Phone_Numbers are the only two fields
used currently.

Step 2
------
Copy the vonage.pl script to ~/bin directory.

Step 3
------
Generate the vonage.xml file from the ~/.vonage/phone_list file
If you don't have ~/bin in your path append the following to your path:

$ PATH=$PATH:~/bin # in your .bashrc 
$ cd ~/.vonage
$ vonage.pl > vonage.xml

Step 4
------
Integrating into the mythtv menu: The mythtv is installed by default in the following folder (on fedora): "/usr/share/mythtv". The mainmenu.xml is the entry point for the mythTV GUI for building the menu. I added the following to the mainmenu.xml file:

<button>
<type>MOVIETIMES</type>
<text>YouTube Favorites</text>
<action>MENU youTube_plugin.xml</action>
</button>;

as a child node of mythmenu element

Step 5
------
Creating the vonage plugin xml file link: create a soft link vonage.xml pointing to -> /home/mythtv/.vonage/vonage.xml

cd /usr/share/mythtv
sudo ln -s /home/mythtv/.vonage/vonage.xml

Step 6
------
Final config step is to create a config file with your vonage user id 
and password to allow your to authenticate to their click2call feature.
The format of the config file [~/.vonage/config] is:

login=
password=
call_from=


That's it. Now when you are watching your MythTV and want to call someone
you can navigate to the mythtv menu and select your contact to call.
Vonage will make a call to your phone and then ring your contact.
